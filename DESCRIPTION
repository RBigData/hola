Title: Helpful Operating Link to ADIOS
Version: 0.1-0
Description: The 'ADIOS2' library is a high-performance I/O framework commonly
    used in 'HPC' environments by simulation scientists. The 'hola' (helpful
    operating link to ADIOS) package is an interface to the this I/O framework.
    It supports several file formats, including 'HDF5' and its native BP, as
    well as streaming data. It also 'natively' supports n-dimensional arrays and
    time series. This enables R to be used 'in-situ' with scientific simulation
    data. The package requires an installation of 'ADIOS2' library, whose path
    can be specified at configure time, but is otherwise easily installed in the
    usual manner.
